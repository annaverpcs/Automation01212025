# Write a Python program that takes a test score (an integer between 0 and 100) and prints the grade based on the following criteria:
#
# 90 to 100: Print "A"
# 80 to 89: Print "B"
# 70 to 79: Print "C"
# 60 to 69: Print "D"
# Below 60: Print "F"
# score = int(input("Enter your University test score: "))
# if score >= 90:
#     print("A")
# elif score >= 80:
#     print("B")
# elif score >= 70:
#     print("C")
# elif score >= 60:
#     print("D")
# else:
#     print("F")

#if - check every loop - comparing to elif
# Check if eyecolor is green, red or blue.

# eyecolor = int(input("Enter your eyecolor: green-1, red-2 or blue-3: "))
#
# if eyecolor == 1:
#     print("My eyecolor is green.")
# if eyecolor == 2:
#     print("My eyecolor is red.")
# if eyecolor == 3:
#     print("My eyecolor is blue.")
